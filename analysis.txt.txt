Task 3 – Networking Basics for Cyber Security

Tool Used:
Wireshark

Observations:
1. Live network traffic was captured using Wireshark.
2. TCP packets were analyzed and ACK flags were observed, indicating established TCP connections.
3. HTTPS (TLS) traffic was observed where the data was encrypted and not readable.
4. DNS traffic was captured where domain names were visible in plain text.

Conclusion:
This task helped me understand how network traffic can be captured and analyzed using Wireshark.
